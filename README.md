# MUI First Attempt

This project was my first attempt at using Material-UI (MUI) in a React application. The goal was to familiarise myself with MUI to better understand its components and capabilities for my internship.

## Overview

The application demonstrates the usage of basic MUI components, including:
- **Typography**: Used for rendering various levels of headings and text.
- **Container**: Provides a layout wrapper for the components, maintaining consistent spacing.
- **Paper**: Used for creating a card-like container to display individual items in a clean and elevated box.

The code creates a simple web page that displays a "Hello World" message, followed by an "Overview" section. Below that, it maps through a list of services, displaying each service in its own `Paper` component. The code utilises MUI's theming capabilities, defining a custom theme to set primary and secondary colours and adjust typography styles.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to gain practical experience with:
- Applying themes using MUI's `ThemeProvider` and `createTheme`.
- Understanding how to use different MUI components to build a basic UI.
- Preparing myself for using MUI in more complex real-world projects during my internship.

## Key Features
- Custom theming with primary and secondary colours.
- Different text styles using `Typography` to create a visually appealing layout.
- Displaying data in `Paper` components for an organised and consistent look.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `yarn start`.

Feel free to explore the code and tweak it to get more familiar with MUI!
